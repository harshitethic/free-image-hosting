Free Image Hosting Script in Php
This script handles the file upload and checks that the uploaded file is an image and is within the allowed size limit. It also generates a unique file name for the uploaded image to prevent overwriting any existing files.

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example, and you will likely want to add additional features and security measures to your image hosting website. For example, you may want to add a login system to allow users to upload and manage their own images, or you may want to add a feature to resize large images to a more suitable size for display on the website.
